# Python Challenge

## PyBank and PyPoll Background

The Python challenge's output are two scripts that analyzed financial records of a company, **PyBank**, and modernize a small, rural town vote counting process, **PyPoll**.

## Python Bank Analysis

The analysis of PyBank's financial records used **budget_data.csv** financial data. The dataset composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The Python script analyzed the dataset and calculated the following:

> - Total number of months included in dataset
> - Net total amount of ***Profit/Losses*** over the entire period
> - Average of the changes in ***Profit/Losses*** over the entire period
> - Greatest increase in profits (dates and amounts) over the entire period
> - Greatest decrease in profits (dates and amounts) over the entire period

The output of the PyBank financial analysis results in a .txt file that include the following:
